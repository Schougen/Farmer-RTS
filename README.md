# Roadmap:

## Phase.1 - Equipment capacity

### 1.1 Tractor Wagons
Wagons that can be drawn by a tractor can be used for: 
-Empty the harvester
-Move harvest to silo or sellpoint
-Can empty/load from: harvester/semi-truck/silo/sellpoint

### 1.2 Harvesters 
Will have tanks that fills when harvesting. When the tank is full the harvester stops and needs to be emptied before it can continue.
-Can empty tank to: wagons/semi-truck/silo/sellpoint

### 1.3 silos and Sellingpoint
for harvest, where you either by wagon or semitruck move the grain to the silo for storage (and get extra bonous when later selling at the grain elevator due to the grain beeing dry etc).
The "grain elevator" is where you sell your harvest for profit, if you sell dried (grain that has been stored for the required ammount of time in a silo) grain you get the best price but newly harvested crop can be sold for a negative hit in income.
-Will be some distance from the starting square

-in future updates storing the harvest until the price is right to maximize your profits.

### 1.4 Semi-trucks
Have big capasity and can be used as field storage and moving back and forth when harvest.
Wery useful when moving the harvest to the sellpoint by saving many trips by tractor.
-Can empty/load from: harvester/Wagons/silo/sellpoint.

## Phase.2 - Constructions
Build you ultimate farmstead in the land immediately surrounding the farmhouse.
-Garages, silos, roads can be built for money and demolished for a cost.
-Use buildings to store equipment and crops.

## Phase.3 - Animals
Barn for housing livestock, storing crops and equipment, and carrying out farm-related processes.
